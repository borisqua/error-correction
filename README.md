## Transmission errors correction

I created these two applications with educational purposes. 
The target is to illustrate classic methods of protection data against distortion during transmission. 
One of the basic techniques of data protection against errors is adding redundant control information to the data.

First look at the "triplets" app, here we use a straightforward, na√Øve approach: doubling every bits and adding the parity bit for every such pair. 

After that, having the general understanding of error-protecting principles, one can look at the "hamming-code" app: the simple realisation of one specific method of error protection: the Hamming code.
