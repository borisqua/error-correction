## Transmission errors correction

I created these two applications with educational purposes. The target is to illustrate classic methods of protection data against distortion during transmission. 
One of the basic techniques of data protection agains errors is adding redundant control information to the data.

In the beginning, we use primitive toy approach: doubling every bits and adding the parity bit for every such pair. 
After that we consider the real one method (one of the most popular these days): the Hamming code.
