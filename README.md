## Transmission errors correction

I created these two applications with educational purposes. 
The target is to illustrate classic methods of protection data against distortion during transmission. 
One of the basic techniques of data protection against errors is adding redundant control information to the data.

In the beginning, we use a straightforward obvious approach: doubling every bits and adding the parity bit for every such pair. 
After that we consider the real one method (one of the popular these days): the Hamming code.
