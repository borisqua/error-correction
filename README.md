## Transmission errors correction

This application were created with educational purposes. The target is
to illustrate modern methods of protection data against distortion during transmission.
One of the main techniques of data error protection is adding redundant control 
information to the data.

In the beginning, we use primitive toy approach: doubling every bits and adding the parity bit for every such pair.
After that we consider the real one method (one of the most popular this days): 
the Hamming code.
