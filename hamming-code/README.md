## Hamming code

In this app we are modeling the transmission of a text file with some random distortion during the process.

To protect the information, we use the error-correcting [Hamming code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_code).

With this code, we check and repair errors if they present after the transmission simulation.
